I am currently an MSCS student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I've been working closely with Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) and Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) on various projects related to 3D vision, embodied ai and autonomous driving.

I'm also the tech-cofounder of [Manifold-S](https://manifold-s.com/). A startup that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for controllable 3D reconstruction and generation. Please check out our [website](https://manifold-s.com/) for more information.
  
Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Fudan University, where I specialized in computer science and was actively involved in the [Zhang Vision Group](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/) led by Prof. [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/). During the spring of 2022, I completed an autonomous research internship at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/cn), a leading company in the field of artificial intelligence.  

My research interests encompass various areas within 3D vision, multi-view geometry and autonomous driving. I have a strong research experience in 3D scene reconstruction / generation, simulation and neural rendering.

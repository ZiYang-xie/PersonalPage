I'm a founder, a researcher, a hacker and a builder in cool AI products. I got my Master (MSCS) degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I've been working closely with Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) and Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) on various projects related to 3D vision and embodied AI.

I'm also the co-founder of [Manifolds-AI](https://manifolds-ai.com/). A startup that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for controllable 3D scene generation, simulation and modeling. Please check out our [website](https://manifolds-ai.com/) for more information.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Fudan University, where I specialized in computer science and was actively involved in the [Zhang Vision Group](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/) led by Prof. [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/).

My research encompass various areas within 3D vision, multi-view geometry and intellegence systems that interact with the real world (e.g. self-driving and robotics). I have a strong research experience in 3D scene reconstruction, generation, simulation and neural rendering.

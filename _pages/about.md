I'm a UCLA CS PhD Student with Prof. [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/) as my advisor. I got my Master (MSCS) degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I've been working closely with Prof. [Yuxiong Wang](https://yxw.cs.illinois.edu) and Prof. [Shenlong Wang](https://shenlong.web.illinois.edu/) on various projects related to 3D vision and embodied AI. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Fudan University and worked with Prof. [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/)

I'm also the co-founder of [Manifolds-AI](https://manifolds-ai.com/). A startup that aims to provide a comprehensive solution for controllable 3D scene generation, simulation and modeling. Please check out our [website](https://manifold-s.com/) for more information.
.

My research encompass various areas within 3D vision, simulation, generative models and intellegence systems that interact with the real world (e.g. self-driving and robotics).

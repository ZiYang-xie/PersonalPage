Currently, I'm a senior CS student at Fudan University where working in [Zhang Vision Group](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/) and supervised by [Li Zhang](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~lz/).  During the spring of 2022, I completed an autonomous research internship at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/cn). Additionally, I interned at [Yuxiong Wang's](https://yxw.web.illinois.edu/) group in UIUC during the summer of 2022. 

My research interests include computer vision, autonomous vehicles, and AIGC. I have a strong research experience in object detection, scene/object reconstruction, and neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Lately, I am working on diffusion models and 3D generations.

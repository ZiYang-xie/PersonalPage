WorldGen is a cutting-edge model that can generate interactive 3D scenes from text and image inputs in just seconds. It supports both text-to-scene and image-to-scene generation with full 360° consistent exploration and loop closure capabilities.

## Key Features

- **⚡ Instant 3D Generation**: Generate detailed 3D scenes in seconds with a simple text prompt
- **🎨 Flexible Input**: Support for both text and image inputs for versatile scene generation
- **🌐 360° Exploration**: Free 360° consistent exploration of generated scenes with loop closure
- **🎯 Universal Scenes**: Support for both indoor and outdoor scenes in any artistic style
- **📸 Real-time Rendering**: Render at any resolution with customizable camera settings

## Technical Approach

WorldGen works in two stages:
1. **Panorama Generation**: Creates high-resolution 360° panorama images from text or image prompts
2. **Pano-to-Scene Conversion**: Converts panoramas into full 3D scenes (3DGS or mesh) for interactive exploration

The system enables unprecedented creative freedom in 3D scene generation, making it ideal for game development, virtual environments, architectural visualization, and creative applications.
